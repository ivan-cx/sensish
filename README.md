## Decision making algorithms

"So long as I build for myself, the patterns I use will be 
simple, and human, and full of feeling, because I under- 
stand my situation. But as soon as a few people begin to 
build for "the many", their patterns about what is needed 
become abstract; no matter how well meaning they are, 
their ideas gradually get out of touch with reality, because 
they are not faced daily with the living examples of what 
the patterns say. " THE TIMELESS WAY OF BUILDING by Christopher Alexander
